# Ivaronix — Build Progress

> **Source of truth for "where am I in the build."** Each loop iteration reads this first. When work completes, append to this file. When blocked, document under "Blockers" and stop ONLY on that item.
>
> **Scope:** Phase A (Day 1-22 testnet) + Phase B (Day 23-30 mainnet) per `BUILD.md §1`.
>
> **Wallet roles:** Wallet A `0xaa95...8677Ce` = canonical for contracts/receipts. Wallet B `0x1Be5...c3d0f` = current Compute API key.
>
> **Commit rules:** no Co-Authored-By, no AI slop, conventional-commits style.

## Day 1 — Scaffold + Network (DONE 2026-05-08)

### Done
- [x] BUILD_PROGRESS.md created
- [x] Tooling verified: Node 22.17.0, pnpm 10.32.1, Foundry 1.5.1
- [x] git init in `oglabs/` with remote `https://github.com/Pratiikpy/ivaronix.git`
- [x] pnpm + Turborepo workspace scaffold (root package.json, pnpm-workspace.yaml, turbo.json, tsconfig.base.json, .prettierrc.json, .npmrc)
- [x] `packages/core` with ULID, canonical JSON, hash, types (network constants, receipt types, ROLES_BY_TIER)
- [x] `packages/og-chain` ethers v6 wrapper (verifyChainId, getBalanceOg, signer support, rejects stale chain IDs)
- [x] `packages/og-router` OpenAI-compatible Router client + Keyring (multi-wallet rotation per HLD §11.0)
- [x] `packages/og-storage` Indexer reachability + upload/download/peekHeader stubs (real impl Day 2/4)
- [x] `packages/og-kv` KV pointer interface + StubKvClient
- [x] `packages/og-toolkit` one-import surface: createOg({ network }) → composes all clients
- [x] `apps/cli` with commands: `init`, `doctor`, `receipt verify/list/show`, `passport mint/show/restore`, `compute test/balance/verify-tee`, `doc ask`
- [x] `apps/cli` env loader walks parent dirs to find `.env` (monorepo run-from-anywhere)
- [x] `contracts/` Foundry workspace: solc 0.8.20, evmVersion cancun, OZ v5.1.0
- [x] **`ReceiptRegistry.sol`** written + 10 unit tests pass + deploy script
- [x] **Solidity bumped 0.8.19 → 0.8.20** (OZ v5 requires; Provus/MUSASHI use 0.8.20+ on mainnet so it's fine)

### Day 1 Gate (HIT 2026-05-08)
```
$ ivaronix doctor
§ 01 · NETWORK
  ● network              testnet
  ● chainId              16602  (matches eth_chainId)
  ● rpc                  https://evmrpc-testnet.0g.ai
§ 02 · ROUTER
  ● key:primary             wallet 0xaa954c33…  provider 0xa48f0128…
  ● default model        qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct
§ 03 · STORAGE
  ● indexer              https://indexer-storage-testnet-turbo.0g.ai  (alive · HTTP 404)
§ 04 · CHAIN (CONTRACTS)
  ● ReceiptRegistry      not yet deployed (Phase A Day 3)
  ● AgentPassportINFT    not yet deployed (Phase A Day 6)
  ...
§ 05 · WALLET
  ● address              0xaa954c33810029a3eFb0bf755FEF17863E8677Ce
  ● balance              70.499496 OG

Status: ✓ ALL SYSTEMS GO
```

### Notes
- 0G Storage indexer responds HTTP 404 on root (no listing route); doctor treats any HTTP response as "alive" since DNS+TCP work.
- `OG_PRIVATE_KEY=${EVM_PRIVATE_KEY}` line in old `.env` was bash-template syntax that dotenv doesn't expand — removed; env.ts falls back to `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY`.
- Bumped Solidity from 0.8.19 → 0.8.20 because OZ v5 requires `^0.8.20`. Confirmed Provus/MUSASHI use 0.8.20+ on 0G mainnet, so this is fine for explorer verification.
- `OG_ROUTER_KEYS` multi-key file format documented in HLD §11.0; for now keyring loads single key from `ZG_API_SECRET` + `ZG_SERVICE_URL` + `OG_COMPUTE_PROVIDER` + `EVM_WALLET_ADDRESS`.

## Day 2 — Receipt skeleton (next)

### Plan
- `packages/receipts` — canonical JSON, hashing, signing, JSON-schema validation
- `schemas/receipt-v1.json` — JSON-schema mirroring RECEIPTS_SPEC.md §2
- 9 receipt types defined as string-union + numeric codes (already in core/types.ts)
- Sign with `eth_personal_sign` (viem on browser, ethers on daemon)
- Verify with `ecrecover`
- "Hello world" receipt locally (no chain anchor yet — that's Day 3)

### Day 2 Gate
- Receipt schema valid + signed + reproducible hash + 9 receipt types defined.

## Notes for next loop iteration

When the next iteration of `/loop` fires, read this file FIRST. Pick up from the latest "in progress" item. Do not redo work that's already in "Done."

If the latest "in progress" item shows recent file timestamps but no completion, it means the previous iteration was interrupted — resume from where the files indicate.

Run `git log --oneline -20` to see the actual code state regardless of what this file says.
